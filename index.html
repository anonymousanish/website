        <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
            When Youwe was not yet established and all the members were operating under a different NGO, the members did more than 35 on-ground campaigns in 4 different cities in Bihar.
That includes Sex Education sessions, Periods of Awareness, Women's Safety Awareness Campaigns, and food/cloth distribution campaigns.
We have also been socially presenting our works including 5 webinars online on issues like Cybersecurity, Mental Health, Domestic Violence and LGBTQ.
